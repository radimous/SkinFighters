# SkinFighters
Enables skins for Vault Fighters in Vault Hunters 3rd edition.<br>
By default, skins used for fighters are skins from the VHSMP members.<br>
To change the skins, just edit the names list in `<savedirectory>/serverconfig/skinfighters-server.toml`<br>
If you supply invalid username fighter will look like Steve or Alex.<br>
To change the chance of fighter with custom skin spawning, change the skinChance in the config file.<br>

Install this mod on server and client for the best experience.<br>
If you have it on installed on server only, skins will still change, but nametags won't be visible.<br>
If you have it on client only, skins won't change, but named fighters will have nametags visible (when naming them manually with nametags or commands).

Build the mod yourself by using `./gradlew build` or grab .jar from releases.
