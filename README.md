# SkinFighters
Enables skins for Vault Fighters in Vault Hunters 3rd edition.<br>
By default, skins used for fighters are skins from the VHSMP members.<br>
Add skin with the `/skinfighters add <name>` command.<br>
If you supply invalid username fighter will look like Steve or Alex.<br>
To remove skin use `/skinfighters remove <name>` or `/skinfighters removeAll` to remove all skins.<br>
To change chance of fighter with skin spawning use the `/skinfighters chance <number>` command.<br>
You can see all possible skins and chance of fighter with skin spawning with the `/skinfighters list` command.<br>


Install this mod on server and client for the best experience.<br>
If you have it on installed on server only, skins will still change, but nametags won't be visible.<br>
If you have it on client only, skins won't change, but named fighters will have nametags visible (when naming them manually with nametags or commands).

Build the mod yourself by using `./gradlew build` or grab .jar from releases.
